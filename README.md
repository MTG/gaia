# Gaia 2

## ABOUT

Gaia is a C++ library with python bindings which implements similarity measures and classiﬁcations on the results of audio analysis, and generates classiﬁcation models that Essentia can use to compute high-level description of music.

Licence: [Affero GPLv3 license](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl.html)

Documentation: http://essentia.upf.edu/documentation/gaia


Dependencies:

  * Qt >= 4.5
  * libYAML >= 0.1.1
  * Python >= 2.4
  * SWIG >= 1.3.31
  * Eigen >= 3.3.4


## INSTALL

### Linux

- Install dependencies (Ubuntu/Debian)

      apt-get install build-essential libqt4-dev libyaml-dev swig python-dev pkg-config libeigen3-dev

   Note that Gaia build will fail if you are using swig 3.0.8. Install either a previous or later version. You will encounter this problem if you are using swig package distributed with Ubuntu 16.04. In this case install the newest swig version from source (https://github.com/swig/swig).

- Online help for WAF (build system)

      ./waf --help

- Configure with the desired options:

      ./waf configure --download [--with-python-bindings] [--with-stlfacade] [--with-asserts]

    NOTE: in order to link Essentia library with Gaia, do not use the --with-stlfacade option

- Compile libgaia.a:

      ./waf

- Install (to install system-wide you might need `sudo`)

      ./waf install [--destdir=/where/ever/]

- Build documentation (optional), it will be located at build/doc/ folder

      python src/doc/regenerate_docstring.py

#### Arch Linux

On Arch Linux the Arch User Repository PKGBUILD can be used to build, package, and install:

```shell
cd packaging/aur
makepkg
sudo pacman -U libgaia2-<version>-<release>-<architecture>.pkg.tar.zst
```

To uninstall on Arch Linux:

```shell
sudo pacman -R libgaia2
```

### MacOS

#### Build from command-line using Homebrew (recommended):
- Install Qt4:

      brew install cartr/qt4/qt

- Install homebrew tap:

      brew tap MTG/essentia


- Build Gaia (this will also install all the dependencies)

      brew install gaia --HEAD

#### Build from command-line:

- Install python, qt libraries 4.8, libYAML and swig dependencies using [Homebrew](http://brew.sh):

      brew install python

      brew install swig libyaml cartr/qt4/qt@4

- Install pyyaml pip package in case you want to build with python bindings:

      pip install pyyaml

- Configure and build similarly to Linux (see above).

### Build with QtCreator (alternative):

#### Gaia2lib

- Install qt libraries 4.8 (including debug libraries) and [QtCreator](https://download.qt.io/archive/qtcreator/4.4/4.4.1/) from the [Qt download archives](https://download.qt.io/archive/qt/4.8/4.8.7/).

- Install libYAML and swig dependencies using [Homebrew](http://brew.sh) (we assume you already have a python installation, otherwise you can also install it using Homebrew):

      brew install swig libyaml

- Use QtCreator to open the project file 'Gaia2lib.pro' in packaging/darwin/Gaia2lib/

- Compile the project (you will probably need to configure QtCreator to work with your Qt installation and also to set up the build folder for the project)

#### Gaia2Python - python bindings

- Use swig to generate the file 'gaia_wrap.cxx' that will be needed to compile 'Gaia2Python':

      swig -c++ -python -w451 /path_to_gaia_source/src/bindings/gaia.swig

- Copy the generated 'gaia_wrap.cxx' to the Gaia2Python project folder:

      cp /path_to_gaia_source/src/bindings/gaia_wrap.cxx /path_to_gaia_source/packaging/darwin/Gaia2Python/

- Use QtCreator to open the project file 'Gaia2Python.pro' in packaging/darwin/Gaia2Python/ and compile

- Run ./make_release_tarball in packaging/darwin:

      ./make_release_tarball

- Copy the folder packaging/darwin/tmp/gaia2/python/gaia2 (created when running make_release_tarball.sh) to the site-packages directory of your python distribution. You can now import gaia2 from python.

### Windows

- Use the QtCreator projects inside the packaging/win32 directory.
