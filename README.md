==========

ABOUT
-----

Dependencies:
  
  * Qt >= 4.5
  * libYAML >= 0.1.1
  * Python >= 2.4
  * SWIG >= 1.3.31


INSTALL
-------

Linux:

- Install dependencies (Ubuntu/Debian):

    $ apt-get install build-essential libqt4-dev libyaml-dev swig python-dev pkg-config

- online help for WAF (build system)

    $ ./waf --help

- configure with the desired options:

    $ ./waf configure --download [--with-python-bindings] [--with-stlfacade] [--with-asserts] [--with-cyclops]
    
    NOTE: in order to link Essentia library with Gaia, do not use --with-stlfacade option

- compile libgaia.a:

    $ ./waf

    $ ./waf install [--destdir=/where/ever/]

- build documentation (optional), it will be located at build/doc/ folder:

    $ ./python src/doc/regenerate_docstring.py


MacOS X:

Build from commmand-line (recommended):

- Install python, qt libraries 4.8, libYAML and swig dependencies using homebrew:	

    $ brew install python --framework

    $ brew install swig libyaml qt

- Install pyyaml pip package in case use want to build with python bindings:

    $ pip install pyyaml

- Configure, build and install similarly to Linux (see above). You might need to run waf command with sudo
        
    $ sudo ./waf configure --download --with-python --with-asserts --with-cyclops

Build with QtCreator (alternative):

(Gaia2lib)

- install qt libraries 4.8 (including debug libraries) and QtCreator from http://qt-project.org/downloads

- install libYAML and swig dependencies using homebrew (we assume you already have a python 
  installation, otherwise you can also install it using homebrew):

	$ brew install swig

	$ brew install libyaml

- use QtCreator to open the project file 'Gaia2lib.pro' in packaging/darwin/Gaia2lib/

- compile the project (you will probably need to configure QtCreator to work with your Qt 
  installation and also to set up the build folder for the project)

(Gaia2Python - python bindings)

- use swig to generate the file 'gaia_wrap.cxx' that will be needed to compile 'Gaia2Python':

	$ swig -c++ -python -w451 /path_to_gaia_source/src/bindings/gaia.swig 

- copy the generated 'gaia_wrap.cxx' to the Gaia2Python project folder:

	$ cp /path_to_gaia_source/src/bindings/gaia_wrap.cxx /path_to_gaia_source/packaging/darwin/Gaia2Python/

- use QtCreator to open the project file 'Gaia2Python.pro' in packaging/darwin/Gaia2Python/ and compile

- run ./make_release_tarball in packaging/darwin:

	$ ./make_release_tarball
	
- copy the folder packaging/darwin/tmp/gaia2/python/gaia2 (created when running make_release_tarball.sh) 
  to the site-packages directory of your python distribution. you can now import gaia2 from python


Windows:

- use the QtCreator projects inside the packaging/win32 directory.
