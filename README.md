Gaia 2
======

ABOUT
-----

Gaia is a C++ library with python bindings which implements similarity measures and classiﬁcations on the results of audio analysis, and generates classiﬁcation models that Essentia can use to compute high-level description of music. 

Licence: [Affero GPLv3 license](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl.html)

Documentation: http://essentia.upf.edu/documentation/gaia 


Dependencies:
  
  * Qt >= 4.5
  * libYAML >= 0.1.1
  * Python >= 2.4
  * SWIG >= 3.0.10


INSTALL
-------

## Linux

- Install dependencies (Ubuntu/Debian)
   ```
   $ apt-get install build-essential libqt4-dev libyaml-dev swig python-dev pkg-config  
or
   $ apt-get install build-essential qt5-default qtbase5-dev libyaml-dev swig python3-dev pkg-config
   ```

   Note that Gaia build will fail if you are using swig 3.0.8. Install either a previous or later version. You will encounter this problem if you are using swig package distributed with Ubuntu 16.04. In this case install the newest swig version from source (https://github.com/swig/swig).


- Online help for WAF (build system in home directory)
   ```
   $ cd waf
   $ ./waf --help

   $ ./waf configure --tools=swig,qt5,qt4 build
   $ ./waf
   $ sudo ./waf install
   ```
   
- Configure `gaia` with the desired options, if python3 wanted use
    ```
    $ python3 ./waf configure [--with-python] [--with-stlfacade] [--with-asserts] [--with-cyclops]
    ```    
    NOTE: in order to link Essentia library with Gaia, do not use --with-stlfacade option

- Compile libgaia.a:
    ```
    $ python3 ./waf
    ```
    
- Install (to install system-wide you might need ```sudo```)
    ```
    $ python3 ./waf install [--destdir=/where/ever/]
    ```
    
- Build documentation (optional), it will be located at build/doc/ folder
    ```
    $ ./python src/doc/regenerate_docstring.py
    ```

## MacOS X

### Build from command-line using Homebrew (recommended):
- Install Qt4:
    ```
    brew install cartr/qt4/qt
    ```

- Install homebrew tap:
    ```
    brew tap MTG/essentia
    ```

- Build Gaia (this will also install all the dependencies)

    ```
    brew install gaia --HEAD
    ```

### Build from command-line:

- Install python, qt libraries 4.8, libYAML and swig dependencies using homebrew:	
    ```
    $ brew install python --framework
    $ brew install swig libyaml cartr/qt4/qt
    ```

- Install pyyaml pip package in case use want to build with python bindings:
    ```
    $ pip install pyyaml
    ```
    
- Configure and build similarly to Linux (see above).


### Build with QtCreator (alternative):

(Gaia2lib)

- install qt libraries 4.8 (including debug libraries) and QtCreator from http://qt-project.org/downloads

- install libYAML and swig dependencies using homebrew (we assume you already have a python 
  installation, otherwise you can also install it using homebrew):
    ```
    $ brew install swig
    $ brew install libyaml
    ```

- use QtCreator to open the project file 'Gaia2lib.pro' in packaging/darwin/Gaia2lib/

- compile the project (you will probably need to configure QtCreator to work with your Qt 
  installation and also to set up the build folder for the project)

(Gaia2Python - python bindings)

- use swig to generate the file 'gaia_wrap.cxx' that will be needed to compile 'Gaia2Python':
    ```
    $ swig -c++ -python -w451 /path_to_gaia_source/src/bindings/gaia.swig 
    ```

- copy the generated 'gaia_wrap.cxx' to the Gaia2Python project folder:
    ```
    $ cp /path_to_gaia_source/src/bindings/gaia_wrap.cxx /path_to_gaia_source/packaging/darwin/Gaia2Python/
    ```
        
- use QtCreator to open the project file 'Gaia2Python.pro' in packaging/darwin/Gaia2Python/ and compile

- run ./make_release_tarball in packaging/darwin:
    ```
    $ ./make_release_tarball
    ```

- copy the folder packaging/darwin/tmp/gaia2/python/gaia2 (created when running make_release_tarball.sh) 
  to the site-packages directory of your python distribution. you can now import gaia2 from python


## Windows

- use the QtCreator projects inside the packaging/win32 directory (not tested).
