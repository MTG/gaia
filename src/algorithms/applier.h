 * constructor taking all its arguments as a string, and a mapPoint method.
 * They will also have to set _originalDimension and _targetDimension in
 * the constructor, as well as the other specific params they need for
 * themselves. A helper function checkSize should be called at the very
 * beginning of the mapPoint method to ensure consistency in error
 * reporting.
 * Do not forget as well to call the transferHistory() helper method at the end
 * of your mapDataSet() function, or you might end up with invalid datasets
 * (NB: it needs to be at the end, not at the beginning).
