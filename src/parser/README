This directory contains the sources for the parser

It contains two special files, lexer.l and grammar.y, which are used
respectively by the scanner generator Flex and the parser generator Lemon

To compile these into C source files, run the following commands (in the same
order, compiling lexer.l depends on the compilation of the grammar):

$ lemon grammar.y && flex -i lexer.l

That will generate grammar.{c,h} and lex.yy.c, which are needed to compile
the gaia library
