 * This class computes the symmetric resistor-average distance of a given Region.
 * This distance is based on the harmonic mean of the Kullback-Leibler divergence.
 * More details can be found in the "Symmetrizing the Kullback-Leibler Distance"
 * 2001 paper by Don H. Johnson and Sinan SinanoviÄ‡.
 *
 * @b NB: compared to the Kullback-Leibler distance, this one also needs the
 *        determinant of the covariance matrix to be precomputed.
 *
 * @param descriptorName the name of the descriptor for which you want to compute
 *        the KL-distance. This descriptor needs to have 4 sub-descriptors:
 *        mean, cov, icov and covdet. (representing, resp., the mean of the frames, the
 *        covariance matrix, the inverse of the covariance matrix and the determinant
 *        of the covariance matrix).
