Natural logarithm of gamma function

Input parameters:
    X       -   argument

Result:
    logarithm of the absolute value of the Gamma(X).

Output parameters:
    SgnGam  -   sign(Gamma(X))

Domain:
    0 < X < 2.55e305
    -2.55e305 < X < 0, X is not an integer.

ACCURACY:
arithmetic      domain        # trials     peak         rms
   IEEE    0, 3                 28000     5.4e-16     1.1e-16
   IEEE    2.718, 2.556e305     40000     3.5e-16     8.3e-17
The error criterion was relative when the function magnitude
was greater than one but absolute when it was less than one.

The following test used the relative error criterion, though
at certain points the relative error could be much higher than
indicated.
