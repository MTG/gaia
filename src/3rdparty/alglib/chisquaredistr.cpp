The incomplete gamma integral is used, according to the
formula

y = chdtr( v, x ) = igam( v/2.0, x/2.0 ).

The arguments must both be positive.

Inverse of complemented Chi-square distribution

Finds the Chi-square argument x such that the integral

This is accomplished using the inverse gamma integral
function and the relation

   x/2 = igami( df/2, y );
