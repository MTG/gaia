/**
 * A SearchSpace is a structure dedicated to the task of storing pointers to
 * Point with an associated distance and is the structure on which the
 * nearest-neighbours queries are performed.
 *
 * It is also what is returned by the view as a search result, and allows to
 * get any number of points with a given offset if desired.
 *
 * Some pre-indexed SearchSpace instances will reside in a SearchSpace pool which
 * is owned by a specific View. It acts as an index, and the pool has a way to
 * either add more of those, or return a given subset that satisfies certain
 * conditions.
 * As such, when a View needs to be revalidated, it will also revalidate all
 * linked SearchSpace.
 *
 * @b WARNING: As we make copies of SearchSpace to perform queries, it is perfectly
 * safe to make multithreaded queries. However, it is NOT safe to add or remove
 * points while there is still a query being processed, or a SearchSpace returned
 * from a previous query still in use (ie: View instances revalidate themselves
 * automatically when a DataSet changes, but SearchSpace ones don't)
